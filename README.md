# Applied Machine Learning


## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our series of Machine Learning projects, conducted by Group 55 during the COMP551 Applied Machine Learning course. Our journey consisted of four comprehensive projects, each focusing on distinct aspects and applications of machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Multiclass Regression.

We delved into a variety of datasets, ranging from medical data like hepatitis, to image datasets such as Messidor, and text data including IMDB reviews and 20-newsgroups. Each project was an opportunity to deepen our understanding of machine learning models, exploring how different features, hyperparameters, and training strategies can significantly impact the outcomes.

This repository is a testament to our exploration and discovery in the field of machine learning. It is designed as a resource for fellow students, educators, and enthusiasts, offering insights, detailed methodologies, and findings from our projects.

### Key Highlights of Our Projects

1. **Advanced Model Analysis**: We implemented and scrutinized complex models like Logistic Regression and Multiclass Regression, focusing on overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, and hyperparameter tuning, showcasing deep understanding of model behavior in diverse scenarios.

2. **Versatile Data Handling**: Our projects spanned handling and preprocessing a variety of datasets, including textual (IMDB reviews, 20-newsgroups), medical (hepatitis), and image data (Messidor). This demonstrated our ability to adaptively manage and extract meaningful insights from different data types.

3. **Innovative Optimization Techniques**: We employed creative problem-solving to optimize model performance, experimenting with various feature selection methods and learning rate adjustments, reflecting our commitment to finding the most efficient solutions for each dataset.
